The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and reading operations with two numbers: a + b, a - b, a * b, a / b. Data is transferred in one form ! Solutions in which every number and arithmic operation is transferred from a new queue are incorrect.
The calculator can work with both Arabic (1,2,3,4,5...) and Roman (I,II,III,IV,V...) numbers.
The calculator must accept input numbers from 1 to 10, no more. Ultimately, the restrictions do not apply to the magnitude and can be anything.
The calculator can only work with integers.
The calculator can only work with Arabic or Roman numerals at a time; when the user enters a string like 3 + II, the calculator should throw an exception and stop working.
When entering Roman numerals, the answer should be displayed in Roman numerals, respectively, when entering Arabic numerals, the answer is expected in Arabic.
If the user enters inappropriate numbers, the application throws an exception and exits.
If the user enters a string that does not match one of the arithmetic operations described above, the application throws an exception and exits.
The result of the division operation is an integer, the remainder is discarded.
The result of the calculator with Arabic numbers can be negative numbers and zero. The result of a calculator working with Roman numerals can only be positive numbers; if the result of the work is less than one, an exception is thrown
